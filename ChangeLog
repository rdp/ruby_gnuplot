2.3.0 Feb 2010

* incorporate a few patch changes

2.2.3.1 July 18 2009
	
* output the raw "to gnuplot" data if $VERBOSE

Version 2.2.2 July 2009

* raise if no executable found, should be windows compat. now

Version 2.2  14-Nov-2005

* Formally added the LICENSE.txt file.  It is the new BSD license as defined
  by opensource.org.  See that file for details.

* Added Gnuplot.which to try and fix the recurring problem of windows users
  having to hack code to get things working.

* Added the Gnuplot.gnuplot function so that I can unit test the finding
  gnuplot executable routine.

* In the Array.to_gplot method the terminating e is added to the output.  This
  is in response to Bug #2209.

Version 2.1  17-Nov-2004

* Array.to_gplot and Array.to_gsplot now support passing in arrays of
  arbitrary objects. This is in response to a request by Yoshiki Tsunesada
  (Tracker ID 1063)

Version 2.0   10-Nov-2004

* The 2.0 version of the gnuplot interface is a cross between the original,
  object oriented version, and the version 1.0 which was simply a string
  manipulation library.


h3. Version 0.9 

bq. 
      My first attempt at a Ruby interface to gnuplot was an object interface
      encapsulating gnuplot language. This was taken directly from the Python
      gnuplot interface. In spite of my being very familiar with Gnuplot and
      Ruby and being the author of the RGnuplot package, I found it
      non-intuitive to use the RGnuplot package.  I found myself constantly
      looking at the code to figure out what I needed to do.
      This was not sufficient and did not sit well.
    
h3. Version 1.0

bq. 
      The second attempt at a Ruby interface was to do absolutely nothing but
      use Ruby's built in string manipulation methods.  This meant that I
      could simply use my knowledge of Gnuplot without having to worry about
      objects.
      While in some ways an improvement over Version 0.9, it still did not sit
      well with me.
    
h3.  Version 2.0 

bq. 
      After attending RubyConf 2004 I was inspired by Rich Kilmer's use of
      Ruby to implement domain specific languages.  That is the current
      implementation of Gnuplot and quite probably the one that I'll stick
      with for some time.  This version combines the direct mapping of the
      gnuplot language without wrapping with the ruby syntax and mechanism of
      adding methods to existing classes to interface Ruby objects with
      gnuplot.
    
h2. Setup 

h3. Version 2.2

    If the 'gnuplot' command is in your path then there is no required
    setup. If the gnuplot executable for your system is called something other
    than simply 'gnuplot' then set the RB_GNUPLOT environment variable to the
    name of the executable.  This must either be a full path to the gnuplot
    command or an executable filename that exists in your PATH environment
    variable.
